            Coat of arms, originating in Europe during the late 11th century,
            were initially employed on the battlefield for warriors to
            distinguish their comrades. These same symbols were later utilised
            on seals to verify the authenticity of documents. The Catholic
            Church also used seals to establish legitimacy and ownership. These
            seals evolved from personal likenesses to impersonal shields
            representing dioceses. Martial helmets and coronets were replaced
            with ecclesiastical hats, retaining the shield.
